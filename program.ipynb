    "# Automating Neuroimaging Analysis Workflows with Nipype, Arcana and Banana &ndash; Swinburne University of Technology, November 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "## About\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of neuroimaging-research data involves the sequential application of algorithms implemented in a number of heterogeneous toolkits (e.g. FSL, SPM, MRTrix, ANTs, AFNI, DiPy). This makes constructing complete workflows challenging as it requires not only the relevant scientific knowledge but also familiarity with the syntax and options of each of the tools involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workshop will show how to wrap neuroimaging tools within consistent Python interfaces and link them together into robust workflows using *Nipype* (http://nipype.readthedocs.io). Participants will then be shown how common components of these analysis workflows can be consolidated within object-oriented base classes using the *Abstraction of Repository Centric ANAlysis (Arcana)* (http://arcana.readthedocs.io) framework, and how this is used in *Brain imAgiNg Analysis iN Arcana (Banana)* to capture the \"arcana\" (obscure knowledge) of neuroimaging analysis workflow design.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last part of the course, participants will learn how to extend and customise the classes in Banana to the specific needs of their own analysis, and apply these workflows to project data stored in BIDS datasets. Then finally, how workflows can be automated for data stored in XNAT repositories by encapsulating them within Docker containers and using XNAT’s “container service”.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Info\n",
    "\n",
    "The full content of this course, all notebooks and slides can be found on the [github repository](https://github.com/MonashBI/nipype_arcana_workshop).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the materials for the Nipype section of this course have been adpated from [Michael Notter's](https://github.com/miykael) excellent [Nipype tutorial](https://github.com/miykael/nipype_tutorial) and a series of workshops he and [Peer Herholz](https://github.com/PeerHerholz) have run on \"Python in neuroimaging\" ([Cambridge 2018](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/miykael/workshop_cambridge/blob/master/program.ipynb) and [Marburg 2019](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/PeerHerholz/workshop_marburg/blob/master/program.ipynb)). The introductory notebook on Python classes was written by Steven C. Howell for the [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/StevenCHowell/python-class-demonstration/notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication in the lead up to the workshop (and afterwards) will be held in the *nipype-arcana-workshop* channel of the https://melb-neuroinformatics.slack.com Slack workspace (an invite should have been sent to you before the course).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you are viewing this course via the [nbview.jupyter.org link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MonashBI/nipype_arcana_workshop/blob/master/program.ipynb) then you won't be able to actually run any of the notebooks. Please see the [Configuring Your Workstation](#configure) section for instructions on how to run them on your workstation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** These materials are not complete yet. If you see the following image then that section is still under construction. Please check back closer to the date of the course for updates.\n",

However, if you would like to run it from your own workstation outside of the workshop please see the [GitHub README](http://github.com/MonashBI/nipype_arcana_workshop/blob/master/README.md) for instructions on how to use either Docker, Pip or Conda to configure a virtual environment on your workstation.\n",
