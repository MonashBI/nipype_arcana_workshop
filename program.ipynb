    "# Automating Neuroimaging Analysis Workflows with Nipype, Arcana and Banana &ndash; Swinburne University, November 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of neuroimaging-research data involves the sequential application of algorithms implemented in a number of heterogeneous toolkits (e.g. FSL, SPM, MRTrix, ANTs, AFNI, DiPy). This makes constructing complete workflows challenging as it requires not only the relevant scientific knowledge but also familiarity with the syntax and options of each of the tools involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workshop will show how to wrap neuroimaging tools within consistent interfaces and link them together into robust workflows using the Nipype Python package (http://nipype.readthedocs.io). Participants will then be shown how common components of these analysis workflows can be consolidated within object-oriented base classes using the Abstraction of Repository Centric ANAlysis (Arcana) (http://arcana.readthedocs.io) framework, and how this is used in the Brain imAgiNg Analysis iN Arcana (Banana) package to capture the arcana (obscure knowledge) of neuroimaging analysis workflow design.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last part of the course, participants will learn how to extend and customise the classes in Banana to the specific needs of their own analysis, and apply these workflows to project data stored in BIDS datasets. Then finally, how workflows can be automated for data stored in XNAT repositories by encapsulating them within Docker containers and using XNAT’s “container service”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full content of this course, all notebooks and slides can be found on the github repository [github.com/MonashBI/nipype_arcana_workshop](https://github.com/MonashBI/nipype_arcana_workshop). A lot of the materials have been taken/adpated from of a series of \"Python in neuroimaging\" workshops run by Michael Notter and Peer Herholz, and Michael Notter's excellent [Nipype tutorial](https://github.com/miykael/nipype_tutorial).\n"
